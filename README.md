Game Objective
The goal is to adopt and take care of country balls (cute ball characters representing different countries), keep them happy, and build your collection.
Getting Started
When you start the game, you'll have 100 coins and begin at Level 1
You'll start with a Canada Ball as your first country ball
Main Game Features
Taking Care of Your Country Ball
Feed your ball: Click the "Feed" button (costs 5 coins) to increase your ball's happiness

Monitor happiness: Keep an eye on the happiness percentage - try to keep it high!
Adoption Center
Visit the Adoption Center to adopt new country balls for your collection
Different country balls will be available for adoption (these appear to be generated dynamically)
You'll likely need to spend coins to adopt new balls
World Exploration
Click "Enter World" to explore different areas with your country ball
Navigate between different locations:
Home: Your ball's living space with furniture
Park: An outdoor area with trees
Market: A shopping area with buildings and shops
3. In each area, you can:
Move your ball around (likely using keyboard controls)
Interact with objects in the environment
View your current position coordinates
Use the mini-map to see your location
Inventory
The game includes an inventory system to store items
You'll likely collect or purchase items as you play
Your Collection
View all the country balls you've adopted in the "Your Collection" section
Initially, you'll only have the Canada Ball
As you adopt more balls, they'll be added to your collection
Game Economy
Earn coins through gameplay (specific methods aren't clear from the HTML alone)
Spend coins on:
Feeding your ball (5 coins)
Playing with your ball (10 coins)
Adopting new balls
Possibly purchasing items
Game Progression
Your level will increase as you play (the exact mechanism isn't specified in the HTML)
Higher levels might unlock new features or country balls
Note: Since I only have access to the HTML structure and not the JavaScript code that powers the game mechanics, some details about controls and specific gameplay elements might differ in the actual implementation.
